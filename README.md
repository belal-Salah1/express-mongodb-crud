A robust backend application built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, showcasing a variety of essential backend development concepts and techniques. This project serves as a learning resource and demonstration of key backend functionalities.

Features
JWT Authentication: Secure user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens.
Password Hashing: Safe storage of user passwords with bcrypt for enhanced security.
CRUD Operations: Full implementation of Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for seamless data management.
File Upload: Support for handling file uploads with proper storage and retrieval mechanisms.
MongoDB Integration: Efficient database operations using MongoDB and Mongoose for schema-based modeling.
RESTful API: Well-structured API endpoints following REST principles for scalability and maintainability.
Error Handling: Robust error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.
Additional Features: Includes middleware for request validation, environment configuration with .env, and more.
Technologies Used
Node.js & Express.js: Backend framework for building the API.
MongoDB & Mongoose: NoSQL database and ODM for data storage and querying.
JWT: For secure authentication.
Bcrypt: For password hashing.
Multer (or similar): For handling file uploads.
Dotenv: For environment variable management.
Purpose
This repository is a comprehensive learning project that demonstrates my understanding of backend development concepts, including authentication, data management, file handling, and API design. It serves as both a portfolio piece and a reference for building scalable backend systems.
